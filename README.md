# FHE-Enhanced Machine Learning for Loan Repayment Assurance using  Concrete ML

This repository implements a secure, privacy-preserving machine learning system that uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to assess loan repayment capability. The model analyzes financial data to predict potential savings, which is then compared against monthly loan installments to determine repayment feasibilityâ€”all while maintaining complete data privacy through encryption.


Privacy-First Financial Analysis: Financial data remains encrypted throughout the entire prediction pipeline
Loan Repayment Assessment: Evaluates loan viability by comparing predicted potential savings to required monthly installments
FHE Implementation: Leverages Concrete ML to enable computations on encrypted data without decryption
Client-Server Architecture: Separates sensitive operations for enhanced security

Why FHE for Loan Assessment?
Financial data is highly sensitive, and traditional prediction models require access to raw customer data. Our approach:

Enables lenders to assess repayment capability without seeing actual financial details
Protects borrower privacy during the loan evaluation process
Complies with data protection regulations while providing accurate assessments
Creates trust by ensuring borrowers' financial information remains encrypted
